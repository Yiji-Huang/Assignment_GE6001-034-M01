abstract = {An optical phased array (OPA) in silicon nitride (SiN) is conspicuously highlighted as a vital alternative to its counterpart in silicon. However, a limited number of studies have been conducted on this array in terms of wavelength-tuned beam steering. A SiN OPA has been proposed and implemented with a grating antenna that incorporated an array of shallow-etched waveguides, rendering wavelength-tuned beam steering along the longitudinal direction. To accomplish a superior directionality on a wavelength-tuned beam steering, the spectral beam emission characteristics of the antenna have been explored from the viewpoint of a planar structure that entails a buried oxide (BOX), a SiN waveguide core, and an upper cladding. Two OPA devices having substantially different thicknesses of the resonant cavities, established by combining the BOX and SiN core, were considered theoretically and experimentally to scrutinize the spectral emission characteristics of the antenna on beam steering. Both of the fabricated OPA devices steered light by an angle of 7.4\&\#x00B0; along the longitudinal direction for a wavelength ranging from 1530 to 1630\&\#x2005;nm, while they maintained a divergence angle of 0.2\&\#x00B0;\&\#x00D7;0.6\&\#x00B0; in the longitudinal and lateral directions. Meanwhile, the OPA fabricated on a substantially thick BOX layer featured a limited steering performance to attain a stabilized response over a broad spectral region. We examined the influence of the cavity thickness on the spectral response of the antenna in terms of optical thickness. Based on the two antenna characteristics, it was confirmed that the grating antenna emitted the beam with a higher efficiency when the optical thickness of the cavity corresponded to odd integer multiples of the quarter wavelength. This work is a considerable strategy for designing a stabilized SiN OPA over a desired spectral region.},

abstract = {We propose a novel type of waveguide grating antennas (WGAs) for silicon photonics based integrated optical phased arrays (OPAs) that require an ultra-large aperture. Our proposed WGAs can realize grating strength low enough for extending the effective length to centimeter level while still keep the feature sizes large enough to fulfill the design rules of mainstream foundry fabrication on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguide platform. Moreover, due to its unique structure, our proposed WGA has a large design flexibility, allowing easy realization of uniform-emission or/and unidirectional emission by employing chirped gratings, apodized gratings and compounded gratings. To evaluate the nearfield and farfield radiation profile of ultra-long WGAs, we establish a simple but helpful analytical model, which can provide information including beam width and beam angle. For demonstrations, we present a design example of a centimeter-long WGA with uniform emission. We theoretically show that a beam width as small as 0.008∘ can be obtained with the proposed WGA, which has minimum feature sizes as large as 150 nm . In another example, by involving two etch depths, we demonstrate that our proposed WGA can be designed to emit around 90\% of the optical power upwards, i.e. with high upward directionality.}}
